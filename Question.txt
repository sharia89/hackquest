You are a security analyst looking into a cyber attack on your company's network. You've found a file with embedded unclear data that isn't in English. Your job is to extract this data and use a mapping file intercepted by our analysts to translate it back into readable English.

Once you identify the embedded garbled data, use the mapping table to convert them back into valid dictionary English words. Capture the 4th character from each word of this decoded data in their original order of appearance in file.txt. These characters will be used to form the flag in the following format: HQ9{<4thCharacterFromDecodedEnglishWords>}.
